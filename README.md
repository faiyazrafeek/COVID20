## Getting started
- Download the projectâ€™s zip
- Make sure you have node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/) installed
- Type `npm install` in terminal/console in the source folder where `package.json` is located
- You will find all the branding colors inside `assets/scss/core/variables/_brand.scss`. You can change them with a HEX value or with other predefined variables from `assets/scss/core/variables/_colors.scss`
- Run in terminal `gulp compile-scss` for a single compilation or gulp watch for continous compilation of the changes that you make in `*.scss` files. This command should be run in the same folder where `gulpfile.js` and `package.json` are located
